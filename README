This is a helper application to offer shutdown options to the user.

To build, run autogen.sh, then ./configure and make.

maybe install cppcheck for lint check

An example of a GTK application for use on LXDE. It is intended a.f.a.i.k. to be built and executed on the Raspberry Pi NOT as a remote shutdown tool.

Seems to be missing : /usr/share/raspberrypi-artwork/raspitr.png

Instructive anyway to see the errors produced by make and lint ...
